        <p>
          Software developer with over seven years of experience delivering agile projects in Australia, the UK, the US and Asia. My technical expertise spans a range of technologies including Ruby, Java and .NET. My consulting background gives me very extensive experience of agile project delivery. Have also coached development teams in techniques to support this philosophy including test-driven development, continuous delivery and deployment, automated acceptance testing, efficient requirements analysis and iterative project management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a particular interest in web applications and enjoy working across the whole technology stack both client-side and on the server.
          I am equally at home combining Javascript and CSS to produce a rich client experience, developing a multi-tier server backend or designing infrastructure to support continuous deployment and support of live applications.
